            <h2>hi, i'm sushie. nice to meet you!</h2>
            <p>My interests consist of programming, gaming and maybe playing guitar when I'm really bored (I'm very bad at all three).</p>
            <p>A goal that I set for this year is to learn programming (C and Rust probably) well enough so I can make neat little projects and
                also contribute to already existing cool ones.</p>
            <h2>setup</h2>
            <p>I use a ThinkPad W540 with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CPU: Intel i7 4702MQ</li>
                <li>GPU: Nvidia Quadro K2100M</li>
                <li>RAM: 16GB DDR3</li>
                <li>SSD: 512GB</li>
                <li>HDD: 1TB</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pretty cool, right?</p>
            <p>Only problem that I have with it is that the Nvidia GPU barely works on Linux so I'm forced to use Windows (sad).</p>
            <p>I currently use <a href="https://floorp.ablaze.one" target="_blank">Floorp</a> as my web browser. It might not be the best of the best when it comes to privacy, but the features definitely
                make up for it. I mean it's based on Firefox, it can't be bad.
            </p>
            <p>For editing code I use <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank">VSCodium</a>. It just werks.</p>
            <p>My phone is pretty shite, I don't even want to talk about it.</p>
